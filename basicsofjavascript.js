8 datatypes in js-undefined,null,boolean,string,number,bigint,symbol,object.

based on assignment of the value to a variable the datatype is set.
if 5 is assigned it will be number 
if "there" or 'there' is assigned it will be string.
if nothing is assigned it will be undefined.

var-variable can be redeclared without error.
let-variable cannot be redeclared but can be changed.
const-cannot be redeclared nor changed,will throw error.

increment-decrement operator same as c++.

undefined variable-on arithmetic operation the result will be NaN 
and on operation with string result will be undefined.

shorthand operator is same as c++.
